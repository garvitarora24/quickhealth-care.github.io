    </p>
    
    <p class="text">
        On the basis of these reports and in combination with the information provided in the anamnesis questionnaire the medical specialist will conclude his second opinion.<br>Medical records comprise medical findings and medical imagery such as MRI, CT, X-Rays.<br>Patients are asked to upload their medical records to their highly secured user account so the specialist can access them electronically.<br> If parts of your medical records are only available in paper form, please digitalize them by scanning or photographing them. Of course you can also send them via courier service to us and the digitalization will be done by DOCTORITAS.
